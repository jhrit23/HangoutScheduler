Hangout Scheduler is an app that makes it easier to hang out with
friends. The app works by allowing one person to create a hangout, and
then they can either specify the date/time or leave it up to their
friends. With Hangout Scheduler you'll be able to create an event, get
everyone's availability, and display the date/time for the event all in
one place.

When a user first goes onto the app, they will have the option to login
or sign up. Once they log in or sign up, they will be brought to a home
screen with a few options:

1.  Create a Hangout

> When a user selects this option they will see fields for a hangout
> name, location, and optional description. After that the user has the
> option to:

A.  Set the date/time

> When this option is selected the user can simply set the date/start
> time of the hangout, and then just save/publish it.

B.  Check for everyone's availability

> When this option is selected the user will select the possible dates
> the hangout can take place. For each date selected they can then add
> the time window(s) the hangout could start in. The user can then set
> the latest date/time other users can give their availability. Once
> this is done, they can save/publish the hangout.
>
> After a hangout is saved/published, they will then receive a code that
> can be shared with other users invited to it.

2.  Manage Your Hangouts

> When a user selects this option they will see the list of hangouts
> they have created. Out of this list, they can select one of the
> hangouts to view and edit. For the hangout selected, they can edit the
> name, location, add/edit the description, and edit the deadline for
> other users to give their availability. Once a date/time has been
> selected, the date/time can be set or updated. The user will also see
> a list of the users that have added themselves to the hangout using
> the hangout's code. This list will show each user's availability (if
> applicable) or if they have determined that they cannot go to the
> hangout. This page might also show the most popular time date/time
> window selected by other users (if applicable). Lastly, they can also
> cancel the hangout.

3.  View Other Hangouts

> When a user selects this option, they will see a few things. The first
> option will be a button to enter a hangout code. In the list below,
> they will see each hangout they were invited to. If they select one of
> the hangouts, they can see all the details (name, location, possible
> description, and date/time if it has been set). If a date/time has not
> been set, the user can then provide their availability if the deadline
> to do so has not yet passed. Users can also edit their
> availability/attendance for the hangout at any point.
>
> This page will first show all the hangouts that haven't occurred/been
> cancelled. Below this list will be the hangouts that have passed or
> have been cancelled.
